A web app for performing OCR on images within your browser using Tesseract.js and client-side Javascript. Upload one or more images, select the language of the document(s), and then view the OCR-ed text in your browser (or save them as a .txt file!)

This app can also be used offline. Click the [Offline Build](https://github.com/ian-nai/In-Browser-OCR/tree/master/Offline_Build) link here or above to download the files you need to run the app without connecting to the internet. Save the files in the same folder, open the offline_index.html file, and you're good to go.

Built using:
* [Tesseract.js](http://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/) - To perform the OCR.
* [Filesaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js) - To save the OCR results as a .txt file.
